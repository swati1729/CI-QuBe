#Connected random regular graph with degree chosen uniformly from valid degrees
#Uses algorithm from Kim and Vu. See: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.random_regular_graph.html
#d=6
#Edge Weights: Uniform from {1,2,...,9,10}
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
