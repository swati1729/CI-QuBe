#Connected dual barabasi albert graph graph new nodes with m1 edges or m2 edges (with probability p and 1-p resp.) being preferentially attached to already existsing nodes with high degree
#See: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.dual_barabasi_albert_graph.html
#m1=3
#m2=2
#p=0.25
#Edge Weights: Uniform from {1,2,...,9,10}
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
