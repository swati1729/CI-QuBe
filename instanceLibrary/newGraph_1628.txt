#One instance amongst all connected non-isomorphic graphs on < 7 vertices generated
#Edge Weights: For positive integers k, we have an edge weight of +2^k with probability 2^(-k-1) and an edge weight of -2^k with probability 2^(-k-1)
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
