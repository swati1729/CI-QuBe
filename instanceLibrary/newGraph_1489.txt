#Connected Watts Strogatz Graph where each node is connected to k nearest nodes. Probability of rewiring each edge is p.
#See: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.watts_strogatz_graph.html
#k=2
#p=0.4164100864991658
#Edge Weights: Uniform from {1,2,...,9,10}
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
