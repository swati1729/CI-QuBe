#Connected Erdos-Renyi graph with p chosen uniformly from [0,1]
#p=0.4624067274884145
#Edge Weights: Unit
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
