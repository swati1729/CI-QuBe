#Connected Newman Watts Strogatz Graph where each node is connected to k nearest nodes. Probability of rewiring each edge is p.

#k=2
#p=0.2840933405799573
#Edge Weights: For positive integers k, we have an edge weight of +2^k with probability 2^(-k-1) and an edge weight of -2^k with probability 2^(-k-1)
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
