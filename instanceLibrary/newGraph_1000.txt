#k=2
#p=0.5005972330077931
#Edge Weights: Uniform from {-10,-9,...,9,10}\{0}
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
