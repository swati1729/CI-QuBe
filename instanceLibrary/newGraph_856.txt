#Connected barabasi albert graph graph new nodes with m edges being preferentially attached to already existsing nodes with high degree
#See: https://networkx.org/documentation/stable/reference/generated/networkx.generators.random_graphs.barabasi_albert_graph.html
#m=1
#Edge Weights: Uniform from {-10,-9,...,9,10}\{0}
# These are the instances of up to 19 nodes that were used in our paper "Bridging  classical and quantum with SDP initialized warm-starts for QAOA" [3]. The precise details for how these instances were constructed can be found in [3].
